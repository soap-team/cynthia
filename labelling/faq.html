    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Thank you for helping us with either labelling or reviewing edits. We will use this data to improve and develop our vandalism detection tools. The majority of people are going to be here to review edits - please read the instructions about 'reviewing' edits. </p>
    <p><b>If you are a reviewer</b>, you should only label edits in 'cynthia-v3-review'. This is the feed that will be used when we start cleaning up edits automatically.</p>
    <h3>I am here to review</h3>
    <p>There are two buttons you can apply to any edit. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>False positive (F)</b> This is an edit that should not have been reverted by Cynthia. Pressing this button will send a message into the #cleanup-review channel.</li>
        <li><b>Save and next</b>: This is an edit that is vandalism.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>I am here to label</h3>
    <p>There are three labels that you can apply to any edit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Good edits should have no labels.</b> There is no need to label a good edit 'good-faith'.</li>
        <li><b>Any edit the VSTF can handle should be labelled as damaging or spam.</b></li>
        <li><b>Damaging</b>: Does the edit deliberately remove or damage the usefulness of the article content? Is it vandalism?</li>
        <li><b>Spam</b>: Is the edit an unwanted advertisement?</li>
        <li><b>Good-faith</b>: Does it appear as though the author of this edit was trying to contribute productively? Sometimes, a revert is made by accident and adds bad content, or a user accidentally removes a word while making good edits.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
    <h3>1. I am unsure of an edit</h3>
    Choose the best labels that describe the edit. You can ask Noreplyz about an edit if you are very unsure - but generally it is okay if you label the edit and you're not totally sure.

    <h3>2. I mislabelled an edit</h3>
    Please open DevTools (CTRL + SHIFT + I), click on the Console tab, and find the diff link that is mislabelled. Then, send a DM to Noreplyz with the requested changes.

    <h3>3. Can multiple people categorise at once?</h3>
    Yes - each user is assigned a 'workset' when joining and the workset is unassigned automatically after closing the tab or window.

    <h3>4. Why are the usernames/timestamps missing?</h3>
    We want to use this data and train bots to only rely on diffs as an independent datapoint. A user's username or the time of their edit can influence the particular label you apply, so it is hidden.
